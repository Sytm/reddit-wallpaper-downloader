# reddit-wallpaper-downloader

This project was inspired by [mrsorensen/reddit-wallpaper-downloader](https://github.com/mrsorensen/reddit-wallpaper-downloader) ([Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/gl62m0/oc_i_made_a_script_to_pull_images_from_reddit_as/)) and powered by a lot of boredom.

## Installation

If you want to access the command via `rwd`, use this.

```
npm install -g reddit-wallpaper-downloader
```

If you don't want to install it globally, you can also run it like this:

```
npx reddit-wallpaper-downloader <command> [options]
```

## Usage

For the help menu take a look at [help](https://github.com/Sytm/reddit-wallpaper-downloader/blob/master/help).

You can also get that menu by running `rwd --help`
